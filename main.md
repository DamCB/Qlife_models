# Abstract

In this second part of the course, we will go over the various methods used to simulate tissues.

We will start by showing a rough taxonomy of cell models in general and we'll briefly discuss the general framework of agent-based modelling.  Then we will see in some details the three big classes of tissue modeling strategies:

1. Lattice based models rely on a descretized space to simulate cells. Each cell here occupies a set of pixels, and the physics of the system is solved locally. Those model are adapted to rapid assessment of tissue dynamics with mixed cell types, proliferation and differentiation models.

2. Cell-center based models. Here each cell is an individual sphere (maybe deformable) interacting in free space with it's immediate neighbours. This class of model is adapted to problems in cancer biology, involving high cell numbers.

4. Vertex-based models. Here cells are delinated by polygons or polyhedron, and the phyics is applied at the polygon vertices. This class of models is widely used for morphogenesis modeling.

For each section, we'll look at published examples and point towards available implementations.


# A rough taxonomy of tissue models

## Population dynamics

:::incremental
* Only concerned with $N(t)$
* Focus on **signaling** and division / death rates
* Main use is **mathematical oncology**:
  predict cancer growth in response to treatment
