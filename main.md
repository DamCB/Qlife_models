abstract:
    "In this second part of the course, we will go over the various methods used to simulate tissues.
    We will start by showing a rough taxonomy of cell models in general and we'll briefly discuss the general framework of agent-based modelling.  Then we will see in some details the three big classes of tissue modeling strategies:
    1. Lattice based models rely on a descretized space to simulate cells. Each cell here occupies a set of pixels, and the physics of the system is solved locally. Those model are adapted to rapid assessment of tissue dynamics with mixed cell types, proliferation and differentiation models.
    2. Cell-center based models. Here each cell is an individual sphere (maybe deformable) interacting in free space with it's immediate neighbours. This class of model is adapted to problems in cancer biology, involving high cell numbers.
    4. Vertex-based models. Here cells are delinated by polygons or polyhedron, and the phyics is applied at the polygon vertices. This class of models is widely used for morphogenesis modeling.
    For each section, we'll look at published examples and point towards available implementations."

## Agent based modelling

:::incremental::::
* Cells are **agents**: they _act_
* Follow each cell behavior
* Broad range of problems:
  - cancer
  - morphogenesis

### The Modified Metropolis Algorithm


The behavior is governed by the definition of a **Hamiltonian** $H$ governing the energy of the cells

Changes follow a simple local algorithm:

:::::::::{.columns}:::
:::{.column width=60%}::::
:::incremental
1. Choose randomly a site $(i, j)$
2. Compute the change $\Delta H$ if $(i, j)$ swaps cell
3. If $\Delta H < 0$ : swap cell
4. If $\Delta H \geq 0$ : swap cell with probability $\exp( - \Delta H / kT)$ _(T is not a "real" temperature)_

### Cellular Potts Model Hamiltonian

The game is now to define the Hamiltonian to better reflect our problem!

. . .

The simplest model: volume conservation and adhesion:


\begin{align*}
H & = & H_V + H_i \\
H_V & = & \frac{\lambda}{2} \sum_\alpha (V_\alpha - V_0)^2 \\
H_i & = & \sum_{ij, i'j'} J \left( \tau(ij), \tau(i'j') \right)
\end{align*}

$\tau(ij)$ type of cell at $ij$

$J\left(\tau(ij), \tau(i'j')\right)$ : bond energy

----

#### Cell sorting

A classical problem:

2 cell types $(1, 2)$ --- $0$ is the medium

\begin{eqnarray*}
J(1, 1) & = & 0\\
J(1, 1) & = & 1\\
J(2, 2) & = & 8\\
J(2, 1) & = & 16\\
J(1, 0) & = &  J(2, 0) = 32
\end{eqnarray*}

. . .

Contact prefered between same type, 1 more so than 2

What happens?

### Chemotaxis

Add a term for chemotaxis:

- chemoatractant distribution on the grid ($C(ij)$)
- Favor switch for increasing $C$:

$$
H' = H - \mu \left(C(ij) - C(i'j') \right)
$$

* The chemoatractant can be *produced* by the cells (cAMP)

- Cells are defined by their position in free space
- Movement goverened by Newton:

$$
\sum F = m a \approx 0
$$

- Forces:
  * Cell-cell interactions
  * Fluid mechanics interactions with the medium



## Mechanical impact of cell dynamics

![Cells as dipoles @ranftFluidizationTissuesCell2010](images/joanny_model.png)

- Cell-cell interactions:

$$
V^{CC}(r) = \begin{cases}
    \frac{f_0 R_{pp}^5}{4r_k^4} + (f_0 + f_1) r_k - (1.25 f_0 + f_1) &\quad r_k \leq R_{pp}\\
    0 &\quad r_k > R_{pp}\\
    \end{cases}
$$

# Cells as polygons

The apical junctions meshworks play a central role in many
morphogenesis events [@lecuit_cell_2007] and are poorly rendered by cell center models.

## Topology of epithelium

### VoronoÃ¯ tessalation [@hondaThreedimensionalVertexDynamics2004]

Instead of focusing on the cell centers, we now look at the contact between junctions

![Voronoi tessalation](images/tessalation.gif)

When distances between the centers change, the tessalation changes.
